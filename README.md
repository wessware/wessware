I am an all-round engineer & scientist with a specialty in Data Science and Machine Learning. I also have satiable skills in front-end web development, Graphic design and UI/UX design. I as well take a keen interest in Research & Development.

I am working on a research project on the subject; Data Loss & Missing Marks in Kenyan Institutions of higher Learning. This <a href='https://github.com/users/wessware/projects/1'> project </a> uses Machine Learning models to predict likelihood & determine causes w.r.t the study subject. 

Also in the pipeline, is a project on 'Start up Failure & Success'. I have completed several other industry-oriented projects using an array of Machine Learning tools as highlighted. I am open to collaboration and currently I am learning Natural Language Processing to expand my Knowledge base in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
