I am an all-round engineer & scientist with a specialty in Data Science and Machine Learning. I also have satiable skills in front-end web development, Graphic design and UI/UX design. I as well take a keen interest in Research & Development.

I am working on a research project on the subject; Data Loss & Missing Marks in Kenyan Institutions of higher Learning. This project uses Machine Learning models to predict likelihood & determine causes. 

Also in the pipeline, is a project on 'Start up Failure & Success'. I have completed several other industry-oriented projects using an array of Machine Learning tools as highlighted. I am open to collaboration and currently I am learning Natural Language Processing to expand my Knowledge base in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
